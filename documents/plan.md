# Project plan

## Language evaluation

One key part of our language evaluation is that the dependency model that it
produces for its users is correct. Thus, we will need to do extensive testing
such that the dependencies within various projects are reflected accurately by
the program’s output. This kind of testing for correctness can be done with
unit testing within the coding environment. We also would want to test our
output for clarity which might be best done by showing example outputs to
other students and getting feedback from them about the program output. It
also may be beneficial to ask other students to try writing a program in our
language so that we can get feedback from outside users about the intuitive
nature and other aspects of the language. As far as the quality of the actual
language implementation, we will want to conform to coding standards in
whichever language we choose to use to implement our DSL in. We also want to
make sure that we are commenting as needed and committing regularly with
useful commit messages. 


## Implementation plan

Each week’s deliverables also include critiques for Tuesdays and design
notebookentries for Sundays.

* Week 1 (Nov. 3 - Nov. 9)
  - Deliverables include: Draft of language design and implementation
    overview
  - Work on designing our DSL and thinking about how it should be
    implemented (i.e. which host language we should use, what features
    it should have, etc.)
* Week 2 ( Nov. 10 - Nov. 16)
  - Deliverables include: Language design and implementation overview
  - Hopefully we will be able to finish this document before the end of the
    week
  - This week will be work on the language prototype so that we will have two
    weeks to work on implementing a prototype of the semantics/parser/IR, and
    other features
* Week 3 (Nov. 17 - Nov. 23)
  - Deliverables include: Language prototype
  - This week will be more work on the language prototype
* Week 4 (Nov. 24 - Nov. 30)
  - Deliverables include: Preliminary evaluation
  - This week will be work on evaluation documentation as well as continued
    work to finalize the language 
* Week 5 (Dec. 1 - Dec. 7)
  - Deliverables include: Draft of final product and write-up
  - Work on improving language prototype as well as final write-up
* Week 6 (Dec. 8 - Dec. 14)
  - Deliverables include: Final product and write-up (on Dec. 12)
  - Finish final product and write-up
  - Spend time working on presentation and demo
* Week 7 (Dec. 15 - Dec. 18)
  - Deliverables include: Demo and presentation


## Teamwork plan 

We plan to work together in a variety of ways throughout the project. Most of
the time, we intend to work together. In the design phase of the project, this
will include a lot of discussion and critiquing. When we reach the
implementation stage of the project, we intend to write most of the code using
the pair programming paradigm.

Without the restriction of a pair programming requirement, we will deviate
from the pair programming paradigm in a few key places. During the design
phase of the project, we will take time to think through the key design
challenges independently. We will then come together with our different
perspectives and discuss what we believe to be the best solution, perhaps
drawing elements from both of the original designs. We will also deviate from
the pair programming paradigm during the documentation parts of the project.
When documenting, we will use Google Docs to collaboratively complete writeups.
We find Google Docs effectively because they allow us to express our ideas
freely and then iterate upon each other’s contributions.

Most importantly, though, we will constantly evaluate our teamwork to ensure a
healthy team dynamic, and to ensure that we are both working on all aspects of
the project.
