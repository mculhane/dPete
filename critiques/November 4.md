* What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?

I think it is very cool that you both are interested in this problem space. It will definitly make the project easier to take on, especially when it gets later in the semester. I also like the focus on collaboration. That is definitly an area that no services currently handle easily enough yet powerfully enough to be useful for anything but the largest projects.

* What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?

It sounds like this project is going to mostly be focused in the language design side of the court. There is not that much engineering to be done after you get a good design. The engineering sounds like almost a stretch goal actually as the interesting part of this is in the design of the language.

* How can the project maximize the time spent on language design? How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas?



* What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?
 
The really interesting part here, I think at least, is how to express dependencies is the absolute simplest way possible. How can you do this such that users will actually make use of this feature? And can this scale? Both to many many tasks and possibly many many users. 

* What are the primitives in this language?
 


* Do you know of any libraries, languages, or projects that might help this project?
