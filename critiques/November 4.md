* What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?

I think it is very cool that you both are interested in this problem space. It will definitly make the project easier to take on, especially when it gets later in the semester. I also like the focus on collaboration. That is definitly an area that no services currently handle easily enough yet powerfully enough to be useful for anything but the largest projects.

* What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?

It sounds like this project is going to mostly be focused in the language design side of the court. There is not that much engineering to be done after you get a good design. The engineering sounds like almost a stretch goal actually as the interesting part of this is in the design of the language.

* How can the project maximize the time spent on language design? How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas? What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?
 
The really interesting part here, I think at least, is how to express dependencies is the absolute simplest way possible. How can you do this such that users will actually make use of this feature? And can this scale? Both to many many tasks and possibly many many users. As I mentioned, a too simple solution and it won't be powerful enough for users to want to use. A powerful but verbose or complicated language and users will not put the time into using the language. 

It seems like there is a lot of good work and reference designs available now. It will be interesting to see what you find as the good and bad design choices in these languages and how you will try to not make repeated mistakes. It sounds like you may be thinking of using Todo.txt as a base. This seems like it may be a really good decision as this language already has some really good priority and grouping constructs while remaining dead simple.

* What are the primitives in this language?
 
Tasks and modifiers. A task seems to be a base unit. Perhaps something called operator or modifier then defines when, where, who, and how for the task.

* Do you know of any libraries, languages, or projects that might help this project?

It sounds like they convered the really important one: Todo.txt. Others include Google Keep, Google Calendar Tasks, Microsoft Outlook Tasks, and sticky notes or a hand written list. All of these have benefits and drawbacks. I particularly like Google Tasks in Calendar for its simplicity of calculating due dates. However, that is one of the only things it does well.
