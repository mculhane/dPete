I think that this project is shaping up to be pretty cool and the features sound super useful. 
A lot of your questions about IR and recurrences were discussed on class on Monday - but we 
still have not come up with a defined IR for our syntax. However, I think that we are going 
in the right direction and once we have figured out the IR we can do some really cool things
with the language. We definitely have to discuss this part as a team, but as far as the 
questions about the Sublime text, I personally think that we should not use it as 
only a database for loading/storing tasks. I thing that it would be cooler, but also more
intuitive to users, if we use sublime to provide an interface that abstracts away the underlying
language. I think that both ideas could work though. Awesome work this week!
